This directory contains all the open source tools that ease my programming needs.
Plugins:
pathogen : Manage your installation stuff.
NERDTree : Filesystem at your doorstep
snipMate : Because who likes typing. Less typing == less mistakes.
fuf	 : FuzzyFinder
l9	 : Makes things easy when you have lot of plugin directories.
acp	 : auto complete pop. The suggestion that you see as popup window is this
	   script.
pyflakes : I do lot of machine learning in python and I want help with syntax and
	   modules.
fugitive : Because you can't program without version control. I use git for that.
	   This has integrated git into my editor now.

vim-powerline : Helps me find the mode I am currently in.
openrefactory : Working currently for c files, but we can extend to other languages.
	        Does lot more than find and replace. Put Openrefactor in vim to see
		other options.

Don't worry about the things that are at multiple positions. I guess pathogen plugin
will take care of it.
